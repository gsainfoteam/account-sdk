# @gsainfoteam/account-core

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- b2621bd: Read IdP endpoints and the issuer exactly as discovery advertises them. `normalizeDiscovery()` no longer takes the URL the document was fetched from, and `AccountMetadata.issuers` is removed: callbacks, id_tokens and token responses must carry the discovery `issuer`, which account-be does from v2.5.0.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 8fcb60d: Ship ESM only. The CommonJS builds did not help: CommonJS apps on Node 20.19+ `require()` the ESM build directly, and jest failed on the ESM-only jose and oauth4webapi either way. Jest users transform `@gsainfoteam`, `jose` and `oauth4webapi` as the account-nest README shows. `@gsainfoteam/account-contract` keeps its CommonJS build for account-be.
- 8fcb60d: RP-Initiated Logout: `logout({ idp: true, returnTo })` on the web and `logout(idp: true)` in Flutter also end the IdP login session through the IdP's `end_session_endpoint`, returning through the already registered callback URL. Core normalizes `endSessionEndpoint` and adds `createLogoutUrl`. Without an advertised endpoint only the service session ends.
- 07ec9e7: Type userinfo fields by the scopes a service declares. `createAccountServer` takes `requiredScopes`, and `getUserInfo` returns those fields as present after checking them at runtime (`missing_claims` otherwise). `getUserInfoBySub` follows `clientCredentialsScopes`. In Nest, `defineAccount` fixes the scopes and returns a module and an injectable service typed by them. The contract adds `UserClaims` and `SCOPE_CLAIMS`.
- 8fcb60d: Step-up basis: `loginWithCode(params, { maxAge, amr })` fails with the new `insufficient_authentication` code when the IdP login is too old or used another method, read from the id_token's `auth_time` and `amr`. Service sessions carry `auth_time` and `amr` from the login through every refresh.
- 8fcb60d: One login flow: the browser hands the callback code to the service backend, which exchanges it as a confidential client and reads the user from the id_token (`loginWithCode`, which now needs the nonce). `getUserInfo(accessToken)`, `exchangeCode` on the server, the browser exchange, `cookieSession`, `bodySession`, `handleCallback` and `<AccountCallback>` are removed.

  The web client takes `api` instead of `session`, always asks for `openid`, defaults `scopes` to the client's registered scopes and `redirectUri` to `/auth/callback`, and finishes the callback itself before the router reads the address. `requireAuth({ returnTo })` guards routes in any router; `<AccountProvider fallback>` covers the callback. `retryLogin` sends the backend's ticket instead of reusing a code. Core adds `userInfoFromIdToken`, `fetchClientRegistration` and the OIDC `login_required`, `consent_required` and `interaction_required` codes.
